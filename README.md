**A Smart Agriculture Cooperative Platform**

Gaia is a distributed smart agriculture application designed to empower farming cooperatives. Individual farms operate autonomous nodes that contribute data and resources to a shared hub, which provides centralized services that are impractical for individual operations to manage alone. This cooperative model enables small and medium farms to access enterprise-grade agricultural intelligence and device management.

## Overview

Gaia bridges the gap between autonomous farm operations and collective intelligence. Each farm runs a local node managing its own devices, fields, and rules.
The hub aggregates insights across cooperative members, providing advanced analytics, resource optimization, and coordinated services—all while respecting individual farm autonomy and data privacy.
